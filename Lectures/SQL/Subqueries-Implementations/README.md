# SQL Subqueries and Implementations

Two goals: (1) subqueries introduced as one final piece of syntax, and (2) SQL dialectal and platform differences introduced, especially including a web interface (such as on data.world).

Materials:
- [Jupyter Notebook: SQL Subqueries](sql_subqueries.ipynb)

## Before Lecture Prep

Have students set up a free account at [data.world](https://data.world).

## Learning Goals

- Use SQL subqueries to nest queries
- Identify common SQL dialects and tools
- Query data from web database
